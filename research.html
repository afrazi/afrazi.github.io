				Wake interactions in offshore wind farms, caused by aerodynamic disturbances between turbines, pose a significant challenge to energy efficiency. These disturbances reduce power output and increase mechanical stress on downstream turbines, ultimately impacting overall performance.
				This research examines the influence of key parameters, including turbulence intensity and yaw misalignment, on wake dynamics and energy production. By employing advanced modeling techniques and sensitivity analysis, the study provides a detailed understanding of how these factors shape wind farm performance. Seasonal variations in turbulence intensity were also explored to highlight their impact on wake recovery and power loss.
				The findings demonstrate how predictive modeling can optimize turbine layout and operations, reducing energy losses caused by wake effects. This work contributes to advancing renewable energy strategies and improving offshore wind farm reliability and sustainability.
<!-- 				Wake interactions in offshore wind farms, caused by aerodynamic disturbances between turbines, represent a critical challenge to maximizing energy efficiency. These interactions reduce power output and increase mechanical stress on downstream turbines, leading to significant losses in overall performance. The understanding and mitigation of these effects are essential for advancing the sustainability and reliability of wind energy systems. In this study, a comprehensive sensitivity analysis of key operational and environmental parameters was conducted to examine their influence on wake dynamics. Factors such as turbulence intensity, yaw misalignment, and turbine operational characteristics were analyzed using advanced modeling techniques. The motivation behind this work stems from the need to address the inefficiencies that arise from wake effects in clustered turbine arrangements, which are becoming increasingly prevalent as offshore wind farms expand. The novelty of this research lies in its approach to integrating experimental data with modeling frameworks, enabling the calibration of predictive tools that reflect real-world conditions. Seasonal variations in turbulence intensity and their impact on wake recovery and power losses were a particular focus, shedding light on the temporal dynamics of offshore wind farm performance. The findings provide valuable insights into optimizing turbine layout and operational strategies to minimize energy losses caused by wake effects. By improving the accuracy of wake modeling and understanding the interplay of key parameters, this work contributes to enhancing the efficiency and reliability of offshore wind farms, aligning with global efforts to expand renewable energy capacity. -->

			  <h2><strong>Smart Mobility Sensing of Passenger Origin-Destination Tracking</strong></h2>
			  <p>
				<center><img alt="PyMyoVent" class="align-center" src="./static/figures/Bus_IOT.png" style="width: 700px; padding: 10px; margin: 10px 20px" /></center>
				Understanding the movement of passengers within public transportation systems is a cornerstone of efficient transit planning, particularly in resource-constrained communities. Traditional methods for measuring origin-destination (OD) flows, such as manual driver logs, are labor-intensive and prone to inaccuracies, especially at the individual passenger level. To address these challenges, this study introduces an automated, computer vision-based sensing system for accurately detecting and tracking OD pairs. This research integrates advanced vision-based modules, including passenger detection, tracking, and re-identification, with GPS data to develop a robust and privacy-preserving approach to mobility sensing. Tailored to the environmental and demographic characteristics of resource-limited areas, the system demonstrates how affordable and scalable technologies can bridge the gap between technological limitations and the growing need for efficient transit solutions. The motivation for this study arises from the critical need to enhance transportation services in under-resourced communities where traditional smart card systems or advanced sensors are not feasible. By leveraging deep learning models and edge computing, the system achieves high accuracy in identifying passenger movements under real-world conditions, even in the presence of challenges like occlusion and pose variation. The novelty of this work lies in its systematic approach to adapting existing algorithms for localized conditions and deploying them on resource-constrained public transit systems. The results indicate that this integrated solution not only improves the precision of OD data but also provides actionable insights for optimizing routes and increasing the operational efficiency of bus systems. These advancements pave the way for broader adoption of smart mobility solutions in transit planning and management.

			  <h2><strong>Seismic Performance of Integral and Semi-Integral Bridges</strong></h2>
			  <p>
				<center><img alt="PyMyoVent" class="align-center" src="./static/figures/Integral.png" style="width: 500px; padding: 10px; margin: 10px 20px" /></center>
				Bridges are vital components of transportation networks, yet their performance under seismic and thermal conditions remains a key challenge in engineering. This research focuses on comparing the behavior of integral, semi-integral, and conventional bridges under these loads, emphasizing their structural responses and soil-structure interactions. Integral bridges, characterized by their continuous and rigid connections between the deck and abutments, are designed to improve seismic resilience and reduce maintenance costs by eliminating expansion joints and bearings. Semi-integral bridges, incorporating limited bearings, offer a balance between flexibility and durability. Conventional bridges, while widely used, often face higher displacements and maintenance demands due to their segmented design. This study investigates the effects of soil-backfill interactions and different connection types on bridge performance under seismic and thermal loads. Through advanced finite element modeling and time-history analysis, it was demonstrated that integral and semi-integral bridges exhibit significantly better seismic behavior compared to conventional designs, owing to their frame action and interaction with soil. Moreover, the influence of thermal loads on abutment deformations and backfill pressure was analyzed, revealing the superior adaptability of semi-integral systems in distributing stresses. The findings contribute to establishing guidelines for optimizing bridge designs, ensuring enhanced resilience and sustainability. By addressing the dynamic interactions between structural components and environmental forces, this work supports the development of more efficient and durable bridge systems.
