				Wake interactions in offshore wind farms, caused by aerodynamic disturbances between turbines, pose a significant challenge to energy efficiency. These interactions decrease power output and increase mechanical stress on downstream turbines, leading to performance losses. Understanding and mitigating these effects are critical for enhancing the sustainability of wind energy systems. This study conducted a sensitivity analysis of key operational and environmental parameters to explore their influence on wake dynamics. Factors such as turbulence intensity, yaw misalignment, and turbine operations were analyzed using advanced modeling techniques. Addressing inefficiencies from wake effects in clustered turbines is increasingly important as offshore wind farms grow. The study integrates experimental data with modeling frameworks to calibrate predictive tools that reflect real-world conditions. Seasonal variations in turbulence and their impact on wake recovery and power losses were also examined, highlighting the temporal dynamics of offshore wind farm performance. These findings offer insights into optimizing turbine layout and strategies to minimize energy losses, contributing to the efficiency and reliability of offshore wind farms while supporting global renewable energy goals.

				<center><img alt="PyMyoVent" class="align-center" src="./static/figures/Bus_IOT.png" style="width: 700px; padding: 10px; margin: 10px 20px" /></center>
				Understanding passenger movement within public transportation systems is essential for efficient transit planning, especially in resource-limited communities. Traditional methods for measuring origin-destination (OD) flows, like manual driver logs, are labor-intensive and often inaccurate. This study proposes an automated, computer vision-based system for accurately detecting and tracking OD pairs. Combining advanced vision-based modules—such as passenger detection, tracking, and re-identification—with GPS data, this system offers a robust, privacy-preserving solution tailored to the unique needs of resource-constrained areas. It highlights how affordable, scalable technologies can address limitations and meet the growing demand for efficient transit solutions. The study aims to enhance transportation services in under-resourced communities where advanced sensors or smart card systems are not feasible. Using deep learning models and edge computing, the system achieves high accuracy in tracking passenger movements under real-world conditions, overcoming challenges like occlusion and pose variation. The approach adapts existing algorithms for localized conditions and deploys them effectively in resource-constrained transit systems. Results show that the system not only enhances OD data precision but also provides actionable insights to optimize routes and improve bus system efficiency.
<!-- 				Understanding the movement of passengers within public transportation systems is a cornerstone of efficient transit planning, particularly in resource-constrained communities. Traditional methods for measuring origin-destination (OD) flows, such as manual driver logs, are labor-intensive and prone to inaccuracies, especially at the individual passenger level. To address these challenges, this study introduces an automated, computer vision-based sensing system for accurately detecting and tracking OD pairs. This research integrates advanced vision-based modules, including passenger detection, tracking, and re-identification, with GPS data to develop a robust and privacy-preserving approach to mobility sensing. Tailored to the environmental and demographic characteristics of resource-limited areas, the system demonstrates how affordable and scalable technologies can bridge the gap between technological limitations and the growing need for efficient transit solutions. The motivation for this study arises from the critical need to enhance transportation services in under-resourced communities where traditional smart card systems or advanced sensors are not feasible. By leveraging deep learning models and edge computing, the system achieves high accuracy in identifying passenger movements under real-world conditions, even in the presence of challenges like occlusion and pose variation. The novelty of this work lies in its systematic approach to adapting existing algorithms for localized conditions and deploying them on resource-constrained public transit systems. The results indicate that this integrated solution not only improves the precision of OD data but also provides actionable insights for optimizing routes and increasing the operational efficiency of bus systems. These advancements pave the way for broader adoption of smart mobility solutions in transit planning and management. -->

			  <h2><strong>Watershed Mapping in Dense Forests Using UAV-Based Lidar</strong></h2>
			  <p>
				<center><img alt="PyMyoVent" class="align-center" src="./static/figures/UAV.png" style="width: 700px; padding: 10px; margin: 10px 20px" /></center>
				Accurate mapping of water bodies and analyzing watershed dynamics are crucial for understanding hydrologic processes like baseflow recession and surface water-groundwater interactions. Traditional methods, such as satellite imagery, often lack the spatial resolution to capture small waterways in densely vegetated areas, driving the adoption of UAV-based lidar technology. UAV-based lidar offers high precision by collecting detailed 3D data in diverse terrains, including areas with dense tree canopies. It penetrates vegetation, isolates ground data, and provides accurate representations of water surfaces and topography, outperforming traditional methods in challenging environments like Florida’s forests. This research applies UAV-based lidar to estimate water surface areas with high accuracy, focusing on small creeks obscured by dense vegetation. By filtering non-relevant data and leveraging lidar ground returns, it generates robust models of water bodies, aiding dynamic hydrological modeling and seasonal hydrology monitoring.

			  <h2><strong>Seismic Performance of Integral and Semi-Integral Bridges</strong></h2>
			  <p>
				<center><img alt="PyMyoVent" class="align-center" src="./static/figures/Integral.png" style="width: 500px; padding: 10px; margin: 10px 20px" /></center>
				Bridges are essential elements of transportation networks, but their performance under seismic and thermal conditions poses significant engineering challenges. This study examines the behavior of integral, semi-integral, and conventional bridges under such loads, focusing on their structural responses and soil-structure interactions. Integral bridges, with their continuous connections between the deck and abutments, enhance seismic resilience and lower maintenance by eliminating expansion joints and bearings. Semi-integral bridges, using limited bearings, provide a compromise between flexibility and durability. Conventional bridges, though common, often experience greater displacements and maintenance due to their segmented design. The research explores how soil-backfill interactions and connection types affect bridge performance under these conditions. Advanced finite element modeling and time-history analysis show that integral and semi-integral bridges perform better during seismic events due to their frame action and soil interaction. The study also examines thermal loads on abutment deformations and backfill pressure, highlighting the superior stress distribution of semi-integral systems. These findings aid in optimizing bridge designs for improved resilience and sustainability by addressing interactions between structural components and environmental forces.
<!-- 				Bridges are vital components of transportation networks, yet their performance under seismic and thermal conditions remains a key challenge in engineering. This research focuses on comparing the behavior of integral, semi-integral, and conventional bridges under these loads, emphasizing their structural responses and soil-structure interactions. Integral bridges, characterized by their continuous and rigid connections between the deck and abutments, are designed to improve seismic resilience and reduce maintenance costs by eliminating expansion joints and bearings. Semi-integral bridges, incorporating limited bearings, offer a balance between flexibility and durability. Conventional bridges, while widely used, often face higher displacements and maintenance demands due to their segmented design. This study investigates the effects of soil-backfill interactions and different connection types on bridge performance under seismic and thermal loads. Through advanced finite element modeling and time-history analysis, it was demonstrated that integral and semi-integral bridges exhibit significantly better seismic behavior compared to conventional designs, owing to their frame action and interaction with soil. Moreover, the influence of thermal loads on abutment deformations and backfill pressure was analyzed, revealing the superior adaptability of semi-integral systems in distributing stresses. The findings contribute to establishing guidelines for optimizing bridge designs, ensuring enhanced resilience and sustainability. By addressing the dynamic interactions between structural components and environmental forces, this work supports the development of more efficient and durable bridge systems. -->
